                <p>There are only 10 types of debates in the software world,
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>
v <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-Andrew-Hunt/dp/020161622X">Pragmatic Code</a>
and those which don't matter.</p>

<p>In this new series we'll see how to stop wasting time arguing which one is best
and start using both instead.</p>

<h2 id="what%27s-clean-code%3F">What's Clean Code?</h2>

<p>Clean Code is about writing for the long term, usually by structuring it with
the help of Design Patterns and Principles.</p>

<p>The assumption is that everything will change given enough time, be it code or
people, and so things should be easy to understand and easy to change.</p>

<p>The opposite of Clean Code would be "taking shortcuts" to get the job done,
which causes maintenance to become harder and harder over time.</p>

<h2 id="what%27s-pragmatic-code%3F">What's Pragmatic Code?</h2>

<p>Pragmatic Code is about writing for the short term, usually by selecting the
most simple and quickest way to achieve a task.</p>

<p>The assumption is that things need to be done as quickly as possible, and the
simplest solution is always the best.</p>

<p>The opposite of Pragmatic Code would be "over engineering" for the sake of it,
which wastes time, makes the code harder to maintain and also makes it less
efficient.</p>

<h2 id="what%27s-pragmaticlean-code%3F">What's PragmatiClean Code?</h2>

<p>As we can see both school seem diametrically opposed, hence the heated debates.</p>

<p>But both seem to be making good points, so why not try to adopt both?</p>

<p>Pragmatic Programmers don't resent structured code or even Design Patterns and
Principles, what they find aberrant is the over use of them and their misuse.</p>

<p>Clean Coders don't dislike simple solutions and they don't like spending more
time on a task than necessary, what they find abnormal is code that has become
too hard to maintain because it grew more and more out of control over time.</p>

<p>So let's <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">develop one universal school of thought that covers both</a>:
PragmatiClean. We'll do so by going over the following Design Patterns/Principles
and give them a twist:</p>

<ul>
<li>Command Bus, by dropping the bus</li>
<li>Adapter to decouple from third part libraries, but only the ones that matter</li>
<li>Test Driven Development, by not testing everything</li>
<li>Command/Query Responsibility Segregation, by making it synchronous</li>
<li>Event Sourcing, by skipping the sourcing</li>
</ul>

<p>And to make all this learning applicable, we'll show some Symfony code!</p>
