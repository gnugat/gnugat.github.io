  <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Use <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> and <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>
  to read tweets, blogs and stuff later (in a commute, in the loo, anywhere).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We often find interesting links on the web, but don't have time to read them
immediately. This article will describe how to efficiently manage them so we can
read them later.</p>

<h2 id="pocket">Pocket</h2>

<p>We all have different strategies to "bookmark" links: actually bookmark them,
favorite a tweet, subscribing to a RSS feed... The problem arises when we do all
of those in the same time: wouldn't it be nice to have a single place to read
them all?</p>

<p>We could use our emails for this: we check them often, we can archive them,
favorite them or delete them. <a href="http://www.google.com/inbox/">Inbox</a> from Google
makes the task even easier: we can snooze an email so it only appears at a given
time, or a given location.</p>

<p>The problem is that it mixes "bookmarks" and "notifications": we could
accidently ignore a business email by mistaking it with a "bookmark".</p>

<p>But don't panic! There's an application for this: <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>
(formerly "Read it later").
The advantage of Pocket is that you can install an extension in your browser so
you can save a link or a tweet, and there's a mobile application which works
offline, so you can read in the subway if you want.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Pocket's ain page is the list of item to read, you can then favorite
  them, tag them, archive them or delete them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="if-%22this%22%2C-then-%22that%22">If "this", then "that"</h2>

<p>The Pocket extension allows us to save manually links, but what about RSS feeds?
What if we're used to favorite tweets (habits die hard)?</p>

<p>Well there's an application for this: <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That</a>.
Basically you can select one of the (many) supported triggers (RSS feed, tweet
favoriting and others), then select one of the (many) supported actions (save to
pocket, send an email and others).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>All the tools are here! They're free of charge and they follow the philosophy
"do one thing and do it well".</p>

<p>I personally store every links to read later in Pocket, either using the browser
extension or with IFTTT using the following recipe templates:</p>

<ul>
<li>If new tweet by specific user, then save in Pocket</li>
<li>If new RSS feed item, then save in Pocket</li>
</ul>

<p>I then read everyting in the subway (no network, but pocket preloads the items
and keeps them available offline).</p>

<p>If you have trouble going back to Pocket, have a look at
<a href="http://geoffrey.io/muna-your-personnal-paperboy.html">Muna</a>: it should soon be
able to send you a digested email of your Pocket's links to read, every morning.</p>
