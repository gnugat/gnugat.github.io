Hi there!

I'm Loïc (it's pronounced "low-ic"), an enthusiast developer constantly curating
content (twitter, blogs, etc) for better practices and tools.

> I wrote about the methodology and tools I use to keep up:

> You can find most of the Twitter accounts and blogs I follow
> [here](https://github.com/gnugat/knowledge/blob/master/read-it-later.md),
> as well as the list of links I've found interesting every year

I'm concerned with code quality and I work with agile methodologies
(lately Scrum and spec BDD).

Everything started in 2004 when I decided to learn on my own PHP and Python.
This then led me to a master degree at
[EPITECH University](http://www.epitech.eu/) (2008-2013) where traditional
lectures don't exist: you learn by developing multiple projects (in parallel
and in many teams), and the only libraries you're allowed to use are the
ones you created yourself (C and C++).

I've mainly worked in web agencies (since 2011), with some frameworks: CakePHP,
home made, Drupal 7 and last but not least Symfony.
This last one is my favourite as it allows the creation of decoupled code
(which means less risk of legacy / technical debt).

> I wrote a tutorial to learn Symfony:
> [The Ultimate Developer Guide To Symfony](/tags/ultimate%20symfony%20series).

I'm currently a Lead Developer at [Constant Commerce](http://constant.co/),
a start up based in London.

> Our customers are mainly brands (e.g. Unilever) and media websites
> (e.g. [BBC Good Food](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/) in the UK,
> [Foodiful](http://foodiful.com.au/) in Australia): we make their content
> (items, recipes, articles, videos, etc) shoppable in one click via your
> favourite retailer like Sainsbury (UK), Woolworth (Australia),
> Stop & Shop (US), etc.

On my free time, I spend between 10 to 15 hours a week on pet projects in order
to learn new things.
I also to contribute to Free and Open Source projects, as I've always believed
in this initiative.

> **Hint**: this blog might talk a lot about design patterns/principles, Symfony and tests.
