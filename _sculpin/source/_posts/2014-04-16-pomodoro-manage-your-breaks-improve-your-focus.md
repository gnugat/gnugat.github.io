[TL;DR: jump to the conclusion](#conclusion).

[The Pomodoro TechniqueÂ®](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) helps you to manage
your time in order to become more efficient with the following schema:

1. work and focus for 25 minutes
2. then have a 5 minutes break from your computer
3. repeat until you've reached 4 work & 3 break sessions
4. have a 20 minutes break from your computer

All you need is a pomodoro timer (I use
[tomate on Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/tomate)), and a strong will to avoid
distractions.

## Benefits

Breaks have been proven to improve productivity and mental well-being. By taking
them regurarly, you should be fresh from monday morning to friday afternoon!

## Drawbacks

One of the points in the pomodoro technique is to avoid any disturbance. But
when working in a team you cannot ignore your teamates for 25 minutes: what if
they're stucked and need your help?

## Tips

You can use it for any type of work. Just keep in mind that breaks should
completly cut you off from your work: if you're a developer, then you should
walk away from the computer (do some physical exercise, or have a non work
related talk with your colleagues).

## Conclusion

Have 4 work sessions of 25 minutes, interspersed by 3 break sessions of 5
minutes. Then have a 20 minutes break, and start again!

This will help you to stay focused the whole day while preventing burnout.
