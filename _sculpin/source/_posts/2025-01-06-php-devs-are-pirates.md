PHP has a long history of adopting, porting, and emulating successful ideas and
tools from other technologies, often resulting in robust implementations that
fit the PHP ecosystem.

Here are some examples:

* [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) (Ruby)
  to [phpspec](https://phpspec.net/en/stable/) (2007)
* [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) (Python)
  to [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) (2009)
* [Spring](https://spring.io/) (Java)
  to [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) (2011 -- that's the release of v2.0)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (javascript)
  to [ReactPHP](https://reactphp.org/) (2012)

Those are old and established examples, but as long as there are creative PHP
developers out there, there'll still be more treasures to purloin.

For example, I've recently stumbled upon [Dan Leech](https://www.dantleech.com/about/)'s
port of [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) (Rust):
[PHP-tui](https://www.dantleech.com/blog/2023/11/03/php-tui-progress/) (2024).

There are no reasons to stop there.

So, what's the next innovation? What other brand new and shiny
(or ancient and rusty) idea can we, PHP Pirates, bring to our colourful
ecosystem?
