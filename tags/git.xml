<p>Wield the crimson blade of version control,
where every commit carves your legacy into the eternal codex of time.</p>

<p>I wrote about <a href="/2014/12/10/keep-it-simple-and-git.html">my git workflow back in 2014</a>,
which really was just <a href="https://github.com/jbenet">@jbenet</a>'s
2013 <a href="https://gist.github.com/jbenet/ee6c9ac48068889b0912">simple git branching model</a>.</p>

<p>I very much like this workflow as I still use it, a decade after!</p>

<p>In this article, we'll explore some of the subtleties I've discovered along the way.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#branch-out-of-main">Branch out of main</a></li>
<li><a href="#rebase-to-update">Rebase to update</a></li>
<li><a href="#merge-back-in-main">Merge back in main</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="branch-out-of-main">Branch out of main</h2>

<p>Whenever a change (feature, bug fix, etc) needs to be made,
create a new branch from an up-to-date <code>main</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="console"># Update main
git checkout main
git pull --rebase

# Create new branch
git checkout -b FEAT-4423-my-feature
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Super Secret Tip 1</strong>: establish a direct relationship between code modifications and project tasks,
  by including the Ticket ID in your branch name. This will allow:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Automated Integration</strong>: like linking the branch, its commits, and its Pull Request
  to the ticket, enabling synchronisation between the ticket and the pull request status,
  as well as deployment</li>
  <li><strong>Traceability and Context</strong>: trace any code change back to its original purpose,
  which can be helpful when debugging some issues in the future</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="rebase-to-update">Rebase to update</h2>

<p>Update your branch often with the changes in <code>main</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="console"># Update remote main
git fetch origin

# Get latest main changes
git rebase origin/main

# Update remote feature branch
git push -fu origin FEAT-4423-my-feature
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Super Secret Tip 2</strong>: Enable git's "Reuse Recorded Resolution" (aka "rerere"),
  for automatic conflict resolutions: <code>git config --global rerere.enabled true</code>.</p>
  
  <p>This won't solve everything for you, but will save you time when the same
  conflict happens repeatedly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rebase command will <strong>move</strong> your commits after the ones in the <code>main</code> branch:</p>

<ul>
<li>it'll be like starting from the latest changes in <code>main</code> as the foundation</li>
<li>then your commits are replayed one by one, allowing for simpler conflict resolution</li>
<li>finally this makes your branch history more linear and clear</li>
</ul>

<p>So for example, instead of having branches look like this:</p>

<pre><code>*   a1b2c3d - Merged in feature-x (pull request #123) (Dev A)
|\
| *   e4f5g6h - Merge main into feature-x (Dev A)
| |\
* | | b7c8d9e - Merged in hotfix-y (pull request #124) (Dev B)
|\| |
| * | f1a2b3c - hotfix for critical bug (Dev B)
| |/
|/|
* |   d4e5f6g - Merged in feature-z (pull request #122) (Dev C)
|\ \
| |/
|/|
* | h7i8j9k - refactor database layer (Dev C)
|/
*
</code></pre>

<p>With rebase it'd look like that:</p>

<pre><code>*   a1b2c3d - Merged in feature-x (pull request #123) (Dev A)
|\
| * e4f5g6h - implement feature x functionality (Dev A)
|/
*   b7c8d9e - Merged in hotfix-y (pull request #124) (Dev B)
|\
| * f1a2b3c - hotfix for critical bug (Dev B)
|/
*   d4e5f6g - Merged in feature-z (pull request #122) (Dev C)
|\
| * h7i8j9k - refactor database layer (Dev C)
|/
*
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see each feature is now a clean line of commits,
making it easy to see what each feature contributed.</p>

<p>The linear, readable history allows us to identify merge commits we might want to
revert, when we want to roll back a feature.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Super Secret Tip 3</strong>: To display branches with <code>git lg</code>,
  set the following alias in your git config:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
   # Logs history in a graph format with colours:
   # * abbreviated commit hash in red
   # * branch and tag names in cyan
   # * commit title in white
   # * author name in yellow
   # * author date in green (format: `Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 +0000`)
   lg  = log --graph --pretty=tformat:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(cyan)%d %Creset%s (%C(yellow)%an%Creset %Cgreen%aD%Creset)' --abbrev-commit
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="merge-back-in-main">Merge back in main</h2>

<p>Once tests pass, code quality checks are green, code review is approved,
and overall the changes in the branch are production ready,
you can finally merge it back to main:</p>

<pre><code class="console"># Update main
git checkout main
git pull --rebase origin/main


# Double check you had the latest changes
git checkout -
git rebase main
## ⚠️ If there are new changes from main, redo all checks (test, code quality, etc)

# Merge your branch in main
git checkout main
git merge --no-fast-forward FEAT-4423-my-feature
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--no-fast-forward</code> (<code>--no-ff</code>) option will force git to create a merge commit,
which then makes it simple to undo a feature, using <code>git revert -m 1 &lt;merge-commit-hash&gt;</code>
(this will create a reverse diff of all the changes introduced by the merge).</p>

  <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Branch only from master, merge back when done and immediately deploy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Git proposes a branch system with the possibility to merge them together,
allowing you to separate released code from work in progress one.</p>

<p>Git flows have been created to help you keep the same process in your team.
In this article, we'll have a look at <a href="https://github.com/jbenet">@jbenet</a>'s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jbenet/ee6c9ac48068889b0912">simple git branching model</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><code>master</code> must always be deployable.</li>
  <li><strong>all changes</strong> are made through feature branches (pull-request + merge)</li>
  <li>rebase to avoid/resolve conflicts; merge in to <code>master</code></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="working-on-a-change">Working on a change</h2>

<p>Changes can be new features, bug fixes, enhancements. They're all coming from
master:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git checkout master
git checkout -b my-changes
</code></pre>

<h2 id="making-the-change-ready">Making the change ready</h2>

<p>Once you're happy with your branch, you need to update it with the last changes
from master:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git checkout master
git pull --rebase
git checkout my-changes
git rebase master
git push -fu origin my-changes
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: <code>rebase</code> will rewrite your commits, their dates will be changed
  (therefore their hash will be changed).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check your tests, the coding standards and ask for a code review.</p>

<h3 id="managing-conflicts">Managing conflicts</h3>

<p>You can list conflicts (if any):</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git status
</code></pre>

<p>Edit your files and then mark them as solved:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git add &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When all conflicted files have been resolved, you can continue:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git rebase --continue
</code></pre>

<h3 id="when-to-merge">When to merge</h3>

<p>Here's a to do list you can use to know if a branch is ready to be merged:</p>

<ul>
<li>is it compliant with the coding standards?</li>
<li>has the code been reviewed?</li>
<li>do the tests pass?</li>
<li>has the Quality Assurance team checked the feature?</li>
<li>will someone be available in the next hour in case of emergency?</li>
<li>does the product owner want this feature now?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deploying-the-new-change">Deploying the new change</h2>

<p>If everything is ok with your change, then you can merge it into master:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git checkout master
git merge --no-ff my-change
git push
git push origin :my-changes
git branch -D my-changes
</code></pre>

<p>It's now time to deploy! You can make a tag:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git tag -a &lt;version&gt;
git push --tags
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Make small changes, release often.</p>
